        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a rather straight-forward &lsquo;birthday cake&rsquo; that we usually bake for birthday celebrations. We usually don't decorate it, but when we do we usually make buttercream icing.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Melted butter for greasing</li>
            <li>200g Butter</li>
